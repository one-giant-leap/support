#How to start a High Speed Data recording

You can trigger the recording of a High Speed Data file in two separate ways - both methods are functionally identical and will give you the same results.

Once a High Speed Data has been triggered, the power meter does not need to remain within wireless range of the device that triggered the recording. The power meter will proceed to record High Speed Data for the preset length of time set in the High Speed Data settings regardless of whether the triggering device remains within range.

The Windows Desktop App will display the number of seconds remaining. Exiting the Windows Desktop App or disconnecting from the power meter will *not* prevent the High Speed Data recording from completing.

###Option 2

* Select 'Calibrate' on your GPS watch or ANT+ display

The following is the process for the Garmin Forerunner 310XT:

1. Press and hold mode
2. Highlight Bike # (choose a number corresponding to bike with power meter)
3. Press Enter
4. Press mode repeatedly to access the Main Menu Select Bike Settings
5. Select Bike #
6. Select ANT+ Power
7. Select **Calibrate**

Whilst on the calibration screen the ANT+ display (GPS watch) will display the number of seconds remaining. Exiting the calibration screen will *not* prevent the High Speed Data recording from completing.

> Note: The High Speed Data file is stored on the internal memory of each shaft of the power meter. The **left shaft** section stores the data for the **left stroke** - whilst the **right shaft** section stores the data for the **right stroke**.
