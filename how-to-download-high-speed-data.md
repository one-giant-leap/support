#How to download High Speed Data

When a High Speed Data file is recorded, the data pertaining to the _left stroke_ is stored on the **left** shaft section and the data pertaining to the _right stroke_ is stored on the **right** shaft section.

To retrieve the complete data set for a High Speed Data recording, you need to download one file from the **left** shaft section in addition to the corresponding file from the **right** shaft section. It does irrelevant which order you download the files.
