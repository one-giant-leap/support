# Perform a 'Zero Offset Calibration'

Each shaft contains a total of _three_ channels which are used to measure the force being applied to the paddle.

These three channels are named **A**, **B** & **C** for reference.

The output of each channel when no force is being applied to the shaft is unique to that specific channel on that specific shaft. The output of a channel when no force is being applied to the shaft is referred to as the 'zero offset'.

The 'zero offset' of each channel can drift a small amount with a change in temperature. This is why manufacturers of power meters typically recommend performing a zero offset calibration on a regular basis (before every session) if large temperature changes are expected.

Note: After performing a number of zero offset calibrations, it will quickly become clear how frequently or infrequently a zero offset calibration is required. If the zero offsets vary by only **one** between zero offsets calibrations, then there is little to be gained from performing a calibration regularly. 

The zero offset of a channel will be between 0 and 1000. Typical 'zero offsets' will change no more than 2-4 from one zero offset calibration to another. A change larger than 10 is an indication that either a bending force is being applied to the shaft; that there is an issue with that particular channel or that you frequently travel between particularly hot and cold climates.

### Step 1

* Place the paddle up against a wall or flat on the floor to ensure no bending force is being applied to the shaft.
* Open the Desktop App and search for the power meter in question.

### Step 2

* Expand the 'Zero Offset Calibration' tab
The output of all three 'channels' are then retrieved by the Desktop App before being transmitted to the shaft to be stored as the 'zero offsets'.
