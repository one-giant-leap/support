    1. Power & Force
> Records power (W), pushing hand force & pulling hand force (N).
    2. Force
> Records pushing hand force & pulling hand force (N).
    3. Power & Force (Slalom)
> Records power (W), pushing hand force & pulling hand force (N). Unlike 'Power & Force', negative forces (reverse strokes) are recorded. Should only be used if negative forces (reverse strokes) are expected.
