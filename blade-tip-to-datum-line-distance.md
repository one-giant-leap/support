### Step 3
* The distance from the left blade tip to the left datum line should be equal to the distance from the right blade tip to the right datum line, If you find that they differ, you will need to reposition one of the blades on the shaft so that the measurements match.
* This distance is known as 'Blade tip to datum line distance'.
