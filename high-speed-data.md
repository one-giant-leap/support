#High Speed Data

High Speed Data is the recording of pushing hand force (N), pulling hand force (N) and power (W) at 50 times a second (a sample every 20 milliseconds).

The high frequency at which the data is sampled allows for individual strokes to be analyzed; left and right imbalances to be identified; and stroke-timing in team-boats to be investigated.

In a sports science laboratory environment, High Speed Data would be the tool of choice for a biomechanist, whereas a physiologist would be predominately interested in Real-time Data.

By selecting a section of the data, average force and power curves can be generated. This condenses all of the strokes contained in the selected area into a single representative stroke (based on the average of the selected strokes). Technique is represented by the force and power curves. Each athlete has their own characteristic curve, or stroke profile.
