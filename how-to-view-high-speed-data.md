#How to view High Speed Data

To view and to perform analysis on High Speed Data, it is necessary to use the [Analysis App](/analysis.onegiantleap.co.nz).

Contrary to what you might assume, it isn't a requirement to have an internet connection to view data using the [Analysis App](/analysis.onegiantleap.co.nz). It is only necessary to have an internet connection to load the page initially. Once it is loaded (and as long as you don't close the tab/window), you can continue to view as many files as you wish.

The following steps will guide you through the process of uploading, viewing and analyzing High Speed Data.

###Step 1

* Go to our [Analysis App](/analysis.onegiantleap.co.nz).

* Drag-and-drop the High Speed Data file(s) (.dat) anywhere onto the Analysis App web page (except the navigation drawer on the left-hand side of the page).

> Note: You can drag-and-drop files individually (one after the other) _or_ drag-and-drop multiple files at once.

* For every High Speed Data file you drag-and-drop, the power meter on which it was recorded is identified and will be listed in the 'Activity Table'.

###Step 2

* The 'Main Chart' is shown below.

* Zoom-in on the specific section of data you wish to perform analysis. To zoom, simply click and drag your mouse across the x-axis and an area of the chart will progressively become highlighted - starting at the location where you first clicked. Let go of the mouse button when you have highlighted the section you wish to zoom in on.

* Once you are satisfied with the section of data which is currently in view on the 'Main Chart', simply click anywhere on the _background_ of the 'Main Chart' to update all of the charts below.
