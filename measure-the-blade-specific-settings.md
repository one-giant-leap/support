# Measure the 'Blade Specific' settings

The 'Blade Specific' settings need to be set initially and updated _whenever_ you:

* attach a new set of blades to the power meter.

---

There are two 'Blade Specific' settings to measure and input:

1. _Blade tip to datum line distance_
> the distance between the blade tip and the datum line mark on the shaft.

2. _Blade type attached to shaft_
> the make and model of the blades you have attached to the shaft e.g. Jantex Beta Large

The following steps will guide you through the process of measuring the distances and settings them on the power meter using the Windows Desktop App.
