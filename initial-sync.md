A sync will automatically begin and activity files will be transferred from the Garmin watch.

Depending on the number of files to transfer, this may take several minutes. A notification will appear when the sync process has completed.

The activity files will now be available for viewing in Garmin Connect, and in a minute or two later, TrainingPeaks. If you are linked with your coach via TrainingPeaks, you coach will be able to view your activity at this time also.
